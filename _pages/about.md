I am a fourth-year Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [MILA - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/),  [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), advised by [Prof. Guy Wolf](http://guywolf.org/). My research interest is in machine learning, dimensionality reduction, and applications to large-scale real-word datasets. I'm skilled in uncovering insight from high-dimensional data, with a strong emphasis on responsible AI. 
I'm seeking internship or part-time opportunities in machine learning research and engineering, data analysis, computational biology and healthcare research, or quantitative finance to leverage my expertise and drive impactful solutions.

Before joining MILA, I got the M.Sc. degree (2021) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), and was a graduate researcher at Network Intelligence and Innovation Laboratory in both Concordia University(2019-2021) and the University of Manitoba(2017-2018), under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Cai](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~juncai/). During my master's studies, I focused on biomedical signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning in telecommunications. Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree (2017) from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(电子科技大学)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). My undergraduate thesis was completed under the supervision of [Dr. Jun Tong](https://scholars.uow.edu.au/display/jun_tong) at [University of Wollongong](https://www.uow.edu.au/engineering-information-sciences/schools-entities/secte/).
