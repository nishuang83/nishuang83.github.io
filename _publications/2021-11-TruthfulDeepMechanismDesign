author: Gang Li, Jun Cai, Shuang Ni
collection: publications
excerpt: 'A new approach of collaborative task offloading in edge computing, called truthful deep mechanism, is proposed by leveraging a multi-task machine learning model, where inherently inter-connected collaborator selection and pricing policy determination are decided by designing two deep neural networks.'
