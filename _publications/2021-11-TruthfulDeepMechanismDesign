collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-12-TruthfulDeepMechanismDesign
excerpt: 'A new approach of collaborative task offloading in edge computing, called truthful deep mechanism, is proposed by leveraging a multi-task machine learning model, where inherently inter-connected collaborator selection and pricing policy determination are decided by designing two deep neural networks.'
