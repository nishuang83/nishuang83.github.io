I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [MILA - Quebec Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/),  [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/), advised by [Prof. Guy Wolf](http://guywolf.org/).

Before joining MILA, I got the M.Sc. degree (2021) in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/), and was the graduate researcher at Network Intelligence and Innovation Laboratory, under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Cai](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~juncai/). During my master's studies, I focused on biomedical signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning in telecommunications. The title of my master's thesis is [Quantitative Measurement of Muscle Oxygen Saturation Using 5-Wavelength Near-Infrared Spectroscopy with Fault Diagnostic](https://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/988003/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor's degree (2017) from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China(电子科技大学).
