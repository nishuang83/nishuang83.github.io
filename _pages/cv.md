Professional experience
======
* 09/2021 - now: Doctoral Research Associate
  * [Mila - Quebec AI Institute](https://mila.quebec/en/), Université de Montréal
  * Supervisor: Professor [Guy Wolf](http://guywolf.org/)
  * Main Projects:
    * [Enhancing Semi-Supervised Visualization through Autoencoder and Random Forest Proximities for Out-of-Sample Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04421)
    * Modeling Dynamic Mechanisms of Drug Treatment Effects with GeoSinkhorn Flow
    * [Capture Continuous Population Structure in Human Genomic Biobanks](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1B-pJMtgQJ97XL4UhuscR5NibF2D3Izt2#scrollTo=hnDGbVOx-bZt)
    * Machine Learning-Based Biomarker Discovery and Cellular Landscape Analysis in Multiple Sclerosis
    * Exploring Biological Features in Alzheimer's Disease through Single-Cell Data Analysis and Visualization
    * Data-driven approaches for genetic characterization of SARS-CoV-2 lineages
  
* 05/2025 - 08/2025: Senior Data Science Intern
  * [Analysis Group](https://www.analysisgroup.com/), Montreal, Canada
  * Main Projects:
    * Synthetic Patient Journey Generation using generative AI: Extended an existing Conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machine model by incorporating additional patient history and integrating an autoencoder for fixed-length embeddings. Applied normalization techniques, tuned hyperparameters, and migrated the model to a larger dataset. Improved real-world pattern preservation, resolved systematic drift in synthetic variables, identified and diagnosed performance issues, and supported evaluation and validation of the improved model.
    * Total Loss Vehicle Price Validation Study: Led data cleaning and statistical analysis for a litigation case involving insurance company total loss payouts. Built a validation pipeline, selected relevant features from provided data, and developed machine learning models for total loss vehicle price prediction, achieving higher accuracy than the insurance company’s algorithm. 
    
* 09/2017 - 04/2021: Graduate Research Associate
  * [Network Intelligence and Innovation Laboratory](https://users.encs.concordia.ca/~juncai/), University of Manitoba & Concordia University
